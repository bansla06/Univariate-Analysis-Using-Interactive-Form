Welcome to the workbook for Exploratory Data Analysis Using User Interface!

Our goal with this step is to "get to know" the data in fast and easier way. Let's think about something.

- When we see the data our first step is to identify the variable and type of variable, how you will do it if there are 100
variable.
- Think like that if you have to do univariate analysis and there are 50 variables, how much time it will take to do by doing by taking each variable separately.
- If you want to do Bivariate analysis, means comparing independent variable with the dependent variable how much time you will take to do that.

What if i tell you we will do all these things in just one click. Just click the button you will get all your result just in one folder and do the analysis in comparatively lesser time.
